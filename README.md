# Functions
Know the basic of "Functions", how it work
->If a group of statements is repeatedly required then it is not recommended to write these statements everytime seperately.
->We have to define these statements as a single unit and we can call that unit any number of times based on our requirement without rewriting.
->This unit is nothing but function.
…………………………………………………………………………………….
The main advantage of functions is code Reusability.

Note: In other languages functions are known as methods,procedures,subroutines etc
…………………………………………………………………………….
Python supports 2 types of functions
1. Built in Functions
2. User Defined Functions
………………………………………………………………………………..
1. Built in Functions:-
The functions which are coming along with Python software automatically,are called built in functions or pre defined functions

Eg: 
id()
type() 
input() 
eval() etc..
…………………………………………………………………………
2. User Defined Functions:-

The functions which are developed by programmer explicitly according to business requirements ,are called user defined functions.

Syntax to create user defined functions:
…………………………………………………………………………
def function_name(parameters) : 
""" doc string"""
 ----
 -----
return value
……………………………………………………………………………………….
Note: While creating functions we can use 2 keywords 
1. def (mandatory)
2. return (optional)
